# Machine Learning Project 2 - Exploring the feasibility of DNN models for the quantitative discrimination between different conformational species of α-synuclein
Project 2 of the CS433-Machine Learning course given at the EPFL Fall 2021. 

## The team (The Regressionists) is composed by:
- Camillo Nicolò De Sabbata ([@cndesabbata](https://github.com/cndesabbata))
- Gianluca Radi ([@radigianluca](https://github.com/radigianluca))
- Thomas Berkane ([@tberkane](https://github.com/tberkane))

## Structure of the repository: 
- `Project2Classifier.ipynb`: notebook containing the code for the classification task
- `Project2NN.ipynb`: notebook containing the code for the MLP approach to the regression task
- `Project2ML.ipynb`: notebook containing the code for the ERT approach to the regression task
- `helpers.py`: some helper functions used in our code
- `data`: contains the datasets for the 3 types of data: pure oligomer, pure PFF, and mix of oligomer and PFF
- `README.md`: this file

Before running the jupyter notebooks, please make sure that the paths used for loading the data is consistent with the location in which the .csv files are stored
